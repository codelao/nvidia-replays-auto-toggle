 If you're annoyed by the automatic disabling of «Instant Replay» feature in NVIDIA App - this tool is for you. I personally lost so many highlights just because my replays were turned off and I didn't check it. Seems like currently there are no easy ways to fix it without disabling desktop capture, so I made this tool that turns replays back on upon system startup.
